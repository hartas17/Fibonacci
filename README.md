# Fibonacci
There is a need for a Rest (or Rest-like) API that can receive an index "n" and returns the Fibonacci value that corresponds to the given index, and you have been tasked with implementing the first version of this API.  Examples: the first values of the Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ..., so, if we were to give the API the index n=3, we should get the response value "2", and if we request n=6, we should get "8" as the response, and so on.
